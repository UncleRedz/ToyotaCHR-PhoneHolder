# ToyotaCHR-PhoneHolder
OpenSCAD project for building a 3D printable, fully parameterized phone holder.

For printing you will need to download OpenSCAD and the scad file from this repository, then use the customizer in OpenSCAD to adjust the measurments to match your phone dimensions.

For full instructions on printing and assembly, see my article [One Day Build: Toyota CH-R Phone Holder](https://open.substack.com/pub/hanstakeontech/p/one-day-build-toyota-ch-r-phone-holder?r=3jjyvu&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true).
